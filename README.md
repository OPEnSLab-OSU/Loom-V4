# Loom - Version 4

This version takes a step back and removes a lot of the aspects that make Loom 3 very hard to work with. 
This results in a more open and easy to work with framework that allows user to choose to use Loom and its features,
or simply use the reliable software written for these sensors without the loom overarch.
